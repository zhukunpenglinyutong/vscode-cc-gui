 * @param {Object} openedFiles - Information about files open in the IDE
 * @param {string} openedFiles.active - Path of the currently active file (may include line markers #LX-Y)
 * @param {Object} openedFiles.selection - User's code selection information
 * @param {number} openedFiles.selection.startLine - Starting line number of the selection
 * @param {number} openedFiles.selection.endLine - Ending line number of the selection
 * @param {string} openedFiles.selection.selectedText - Content of the selected code
 * @param {string[]} openedFiles.others - List of other open file paths
 * @param {string} agentPrompt - Agent prompt (optional)
 * @returns {string} The constructed system prompt, or an empty string if there's no valid information
